we can’t run the modern world without software. National infrastructures and utilities are controlled by computer-based systems and most electrical products include a
computer and controlling software. Industrial manufacturing and distribution is
completely computerized, as is the financial system. Entertainment, including the
music industry, computer games, and film and television, is software intensive.
Therefore, software engineering is essential for the functioning of national and international societies.
Software systems are abstract and intangible. They are not constrained by the
properties of materials, governed by physical laws, or by manufacturing processes.
This simplifies software engineering, as there are no natural limits to the potential of
software. However, because of the lack of physical constraints, software systems can
quickly become extremely complex, difficult to understand, and expensive to change.
There are many different types of software systems, from simple embedded systems to complex, worldwide information systems. It is pointless to look for universal
notations, methods, or techniques for software engineering because different types
of software require different approaches. Developing an organizational information
system is completely different from developing a controller for a scientific instrument. Neither of these systems has much in common with a graphics-intensive computer game. All of these applications need software engineering; they do not all need
the same software engineering techniques.
There are still many reports of software projects going wrong and ‘software failures’.
Software engineering is criticized as inadequate for modern software development.
